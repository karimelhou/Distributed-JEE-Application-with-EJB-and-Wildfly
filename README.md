# Distributed JEE Application with EJB and Wildfly

This project is a comprehensive Java EE (Enterprise Edition) application that showcases the development of a distributed system using Enterprise JavaBeans (EJB) technology and the Wildfly application server. It comprises a backend EJB application that encapsulates business logic and a client project that communicates seamlessly with the EJBs through Java Naming and Directory Interface (JNDI). The application demonstrates the power of EJBs in building scalable and robust enterprise-level software systems.

## Introduction

In an era driven by information technology, the efficient management of data and resources plays a pivotal role in the success of organizations, institutions, and enterprises. In the context of educational institutions, managing student information is a crucial aspect of ensuring smooth administrative processes and providing a seamless experience for both students and faculty. This report sheds light on the development of an EJB (Enterprise JavaBeans) based web application aimed at facilitating the management of student information, referred to as "Etudiants" (students).

Project Components:
The project encompasses two key components. The first is a backend EJB application, responsible for storing, retrieving, updating, and deleting student information. This application leverages the power of EJBs to provide the necessary business logic and data access. It includes an Entity Bean to represent student data, a Session Bean to serve as the business logic layer, and a Remote Interface defining the methods accessible to clients.

The second component is the frontend web application, which allows users to interact with the EJB-based backend. This interaction is facilitated through a set of servlets, each of which corresponds to a specific operation on student records, namely creating, updating, deleting, and retrieving. These servlets enable the application to respond to HTTP requests from clients, process the requests, and communicate with the EJB backend to perform the desired actions.

Furthermore, the report also discusses the essential configuration steps, including the establishment of a data source for MySQL, which acts as the database for storing student information. User management in WildFly is configured to ensure the security of the application, granting appropriate access rights to users based on their roles and responsibilities.

Project Objective:
The primary objective of this project is to provide a robust and scalable solution for managing student information in an educational context. It encapsulates the essence of Java EE (Enterprise Edition) and EJBs, illustrating the power of these technologies in simplifying data management tasks while ensuring security and performance.

In conclusion, the development of this EJB-based web application serves as an excellent example of how modern technology can streamline the management of student information, ultimately contributing to more efficient educational processes. The report is structured to guide readers through the project's key aspects, from its architecture to implementation details and further possibilities for enhancements and refinements.
